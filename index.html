  <h1>Are you too old to be a cycling legend?</h1>
  <p>A reflection on over 100 winners of the Tour de France, shows that the average age might be higher than you think</p>

      <h4>Alberto Contador concluded his last race, the Criterium Shangai, on October 29.</h4>
      <p>The Criterium Shanghai is a race laid by the organisers of the Tour de France, another competition that the Spaniard knows well in his career, having won two of them. But the Tour de France was not the only hunting ground of “El Pistolero”: he also collected two Giro d’Italia trophies and three victories during the Vuelta a Espana.</p>
      <p>The 2017 Vuelta was the unofficial retirement of the -now officially- former professional cyclist: every fan will remember his victory on atop the Alto del l’Angliru and his huge smile in Madrid on September 10. Contador has won many Grand Tour (the most traditional races) and he will be remembered from one or two generations of fans.</p>
      <p>He retires at the age of 34, two years after his last major victory, the 2015 Giro, when he was 32. Chris Froome, who has beaten him twice this year to win the Vuelta and the Tour, is currently 31, and some detractors already started to say that he will be to old to repeat himself. Vincenzo Nibali, the Italian who arrived second at this year’s Vuelta is currently 32 and won his last major trophy, the Giro d’Italia only one year ago. Are Nibali and Froome past their prime or still physically able to win?</p>
      <p>And moreover: when is the exact time when cyclists become too old? What is the average age of winners of the main competitions?</p>

      <p>Is cycling a sport for young champions now? The records of the past inebriate the fan with the histories of great heroes who dominated the sport for years: Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, Felice Gimondi, Eddie Merckx,  who won for several years and started to collect trophies early.</p>
      <p>When Chris Froome started his “treble” of Tour de France (he won the editions of 2015,2016 and 2017) he was 29.  And he won the Vuelta this year as 31. Different was the verdict of the Vuelta in 2016 and the Giro this year, who went respectively to a 27-years-old, Nairo Quintana, and to a 26-years-old Tom Dumoulin.</p>
      <p>In the first ten places of this year’s Tour six cyclists have less than 30 years (Romain Bardet, Mikel Linda, Fabio Aru, Simon Yates and Louis Meintjes, Warren Barguil) the other four (Chris Froome, Rigoberto Uràn, Dan Martin,Alberto Contador) have the median age of nearly 32 years (31.75). Seven out of ten of the cyclists who are less than 30 also compose the top ten of this year’s Giro: the old Shark Nibali Domenico Pozzovivo and Bauke Mollema being the only exceptions. This year’s vuelta showed a 50/50 split in the top ten five are in their thirties (the winner, again Nibali, the the most combative Contador, the Canadian Michael Woods and the Spaniard José Joaquin Rojas) and five under that age (the Italian Matteo Trentin, Wilco Kelderman, the Russian all-rounder Ilnur Zakarin and the two Colombians Miguel Angel Lòpez and Esteban Chavez).</p>
      <p><strong>The most effective way to do this simply is the following: select a winner from every yeat (a winner that was 26, one that was 27 etc) and make people choose their age in a dropdown menu. If not all of the years are covered we could say "nobody has win at your age, you can be the first, start training.</strong></p>
